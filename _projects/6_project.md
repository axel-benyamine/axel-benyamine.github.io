A project done with Dimitri de Saint Guilhem under the supervision of Marceau Coupechoux as part of Polytechnique's course 'INF421 Algorithm Design and Analysis' by Benjamin Doerr.

Considering a sensor network as a undirected weighted graph, whose nodes are sensors and relay nodes (an edge indicates that a wireless communication is possible between two nodes, an edge weight represents the cost of transmitting a message along this edge), we looked for a set of routes of minimal weight connecting all sensors together. This is related to the Steiner tree problem, where sensors are terminals and routes form a Steiner tree. We implemented algorithms to solve this problem and tested it on six different graph scenarios.
