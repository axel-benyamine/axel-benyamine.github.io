During my graduate research internship at MIT under the supervision of Prof. Jacquillat, I worked on developping optimization models and algorithms to support infill development in major cities, with the objective of maximizing a social welfare function.

I undertook data collection, model development, mathematical analysis, and computational activities.

You can find below the project Report and the Slides I've done for my projet defense at Ecole Polytechnique.
