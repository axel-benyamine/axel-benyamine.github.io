A team project ('TIPE') for French 'Grandes Ecoles' entrance exams done with Julien Lambert, Guillaume Février and Jérome Collin-Lizan under the supervision of Prof. Aymeric Autin.

We designed and implement on Python an end-to-end public-key cryptography system whose security relies on the non-commutativity of the braid group.

You can find below the project Slides I've done for the project defense and a (small) report done for ENS' entrance oral exam.
