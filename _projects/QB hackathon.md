A 24h Hackathon organised by McKinsey QuantumBlack about the use of AI to identify methane leaks. 

Our team (with Pierre Agui√©, Louis Collomb and Dimitri de Saint Guilhem) implemented a Deep Learning model to identify methane leaks from satelite pictures, created a website integrating the model, and designed a Business Model for a potential future start-up.

We won the Hackathon (1st) among 15 teams of Polytechnique students.
