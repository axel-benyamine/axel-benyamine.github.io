A scientific team project ('PSC') at Ecole Polytechnique done with BORDERIES Titouan, COLLOMB Louis, DELPECH de SAINT GUILHEM Dimitri and DIBY Wilfried under the supervision of Ass. Prof. Lucas Gerin.

We designed and implemented multiple solvers for the game Dots and Boxes, among which an innovative solver based on the MiniMax and Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithms.

You can find below the project Report and the Slides we've done for the project defense.
