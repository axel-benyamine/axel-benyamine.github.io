A project done with Louis Collomb and Othman Hicheur as part of Polytechnique's course 'INF554 Machine and Deep Learning' by Prof. Michalis Vazirgiannis.

Given discourse graphs, we built an extractive summarization system that can binarily predict whether each utterance in a dialogue transcription is important or not (with label 1 or 0), comparing multiple Deep Learning architectures as long as different preprocessing techniques.

You can find below the project Slides we've done for the project defense.
