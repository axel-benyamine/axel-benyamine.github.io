I am a first year PhD at Ecole Polytechnique and INRIA Paris under the supervision of Michael I. Jordan, Alain Durmus and Julien Grand-Clément. 

Before that, I did a master at University of Cambridge in Statistics and Probabilities (Part III master) and a master (Cycle Ingénieur, X2021 cohort) at Ecole Polytechnique in which I specialised towards Applied Mathematics with special interests in Statistics, Optimisation and Machine Learning.
