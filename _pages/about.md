I am a fourth year student at Ecole Polytechnique (member of X2021 cohort), currently doing a double-degree at University of Cambridge in Statistics and Probabilities in Part III master. At Ecole Polytechnique, I specialised towards Applied Mathematics with special interests in Statistics, Optimisation and Machine Learning.
